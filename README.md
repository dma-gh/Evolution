## Evolution

Evolution is a program which uses an evolutionary method of randomization to solve a problem. At the moment, it can only solve the problem of 
transforming one number into another through random arithmetic operations.

### In the future

Evolution will be able to solve simple and eventually advanced mathematic algorithms through it's use of processed based randomization.
This is known as the evolutionary method, in this case applied to computing.

### Installation
 	$make 
### Execution
	./rand [Starting Point] [Goal] [Equations] [Deviation]
	Equations: [1 : 0] Enables or disables printing equations
	Deviation: [1 : 0] Enables or disables showing current fitness
